This project is made with the help of FuckAdBlock Repo.

I have added some UI so that website owners can use this script more conveniently to get more earnings from there traffic. Its a simple script to detect AdBlockers like AdBlock, AdBlockPlus. 

If a user is detected using AdBlocker then the site automatically prompts to either turn-off the adblocker or pay a small amount via paypal and use the website with AdBlocker enabled.

Website owner gets an option to earn from user in every possible way.
